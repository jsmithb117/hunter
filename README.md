It's Minesweeper with a twist!  It's also a work in progress.

You begin with three health bars and a completely covered board.  
There are four types of pieces.  Viruses, Vaccines, Lockdowns, and Empty pieces.  
Right-click to flag a virus.  
Left click to uncover a piece.  
If you left click on a Virus, you lose a health bar and incur 30 penalty points. When you have no health remaining, the game is over. 
If you uncover a Vaccine, you are granted one more health bar.
If that piece is a Lockdown, you incur penalty points.
If you uncover all of the pieces that are not a virus, you win!
